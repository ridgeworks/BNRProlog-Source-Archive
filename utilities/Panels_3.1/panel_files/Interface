Panels 3.1 Interface:
---------------------

A panel structure is defined by a fact of the form:

    panel_definition(Name,                  % a symbol naming the panel or panel template
                     pos(X,Y),              % default position of the panel
                     size(W,H),             % size of the panel
                     options(style(Style),         % panel style, one of document, dialog,
                                                   %   rectangle, shadow, rounded, or motif
                             background(Pat,Col),  % background pattern and colour
                             picture(File,Id),     % file name and resource Id of 
                                                   %   background picture
                             lock(Lock),           % disable panel/editing if Lock=on
                             dialog(Dial)          % modal dialog if Dial=on
                             grid(GX,GY)           % grid pitch (in pixels) 
                            )                      %   in X and Y direction
                     Itemlist..             % sequence of items in the panel
                    )                       %   (see new class structures)

    The operational behaviour of the panel can be affected by the 'lock' option (disables
object selection for editing, or resizing of the panel) and by the 'dialog' option (disables
switching the active window via mouse selection; in the Prolog environment, window selection
from the 'Windows' menu is still operational.)  The 'background' and 'picture' options are
used to place a background 'under' any of the other panel objects.  Transparent objects
allow the background pattern and colour to show through; transparent buttons with no label
or icon (equivalent of a hotspot) allow pictures to show through.  The grid is used by the
panel editor to help the user line up objects on the panel.

    The panel defintion can be used as is, or as a template for instances of the panel.
Such instances have a name of the form Name:Instance, where Name matches the Name found in
the panel_definition clause, and instance is a Prolog term assigned by the application when the
panel is created (opened).  Instances cannot be saved as a panel definition; however, they 
can be renamed to a symbol, and then saved. 

The semantics for this structure are supported mainly through rules (panel_event)
which are executed when certain events occur, and rules which query and modify
the state of items in the panel:

    panel_event(Panel,Event,Item)    -- responding to user actions, you will
                                        always need event handlers to animate
                                        your panels.    
    
    panel_view(Panel,Item_access..)  -- read or write values into the panel, you
                                        will need this call in your event handlers
                                        to act on the panel.  


panel_event(Panel, Event, Item)
-------------------------------

    Panel   =   the panel's name (e.g., fred  or  fred:42).
    Event   =   short form is select, click, etc (listed below)
            =   long form is select(X,Y), click(X,Y), etc (listed below)
            =   alternative long form if any modifier keys are depressed:
                    Event(X,Y,Ctrl,Opt,Shft,Cmnd) (1=depressed, otherwise 0)
    Item    =   short form is Class(Name)
            =   long form is Class(name(Name),place(XL,YT,XR,YB),Properties..)  
                    
    where:   Class = button, field, etc... (the items class)
             Name  = the internal identifier for a panel item, e.g., fred, sam(2)
             place(XL,YT,XR,YB) = 
                location of the object as rectangle
             Properties.. = 
                a sequence of class specific properties, each of the form Prop(Value..),
                which define additional characteristics, e.g., style, font, etc., or
                state of the Item.
                            

    Note: all four combinations and short and long form of the event and item are supported. 

example:
      panel_event(my_panel,click,button('OK'))
      panel_event(my_panel,click(96,36),button('OK'))
      panel_event(my_panel,click,button(name('OK'),place(90,30,120,50),style(designate),
                                        label('OK'),state(off),font(0,12),icon(0),menu()))
      panel_event(my_panel,click(96,36,0,0,1,0),button(name('OK'),place(90,30,120,50),Etc..))
                            % Etc.. is unified with the remainder of item's properties

Events:

    select(X,Y) 
                mouse at X,Y down on an Item. 
                Examples:
                Item = button(fred) user event handler;
                       a default item event handler will highlight the button

    unselect(X,Y) 
                mouseup at X,Y after a select, mouse may not be on the Item
                Note: this is often ignored, but for example, the default button
                       event handler will remove the buttons highlight.

    click(X,Y)  
                mouseup at X,Y after an unselect, and the mouse is still on the Item
                Note: this event is always proceeded by a select and un unselect.

    doubleclick(X,Y) 
                mouse down/up/down at X,Y all within the desktop's double click time
                Note: this event is always proceeded by a click.

    downidle(X,Y)
                idle event, mouse button is down

    upidle(X,Y)
                idle event, mouse button is up

    keystroke(Key,Mods)

                userkey event,where Key is a single character symbol and Mods is a list 
                of six integers (0 or 1) defining the state of the modifier keys as in: 
                    [Control,Option,Capslock,Shift,Command,Mouseup]
                (The item is set to the void).  

    others..    specific to item classes (may be extended by new classes) 
                See class documentation.


panel_event(Panel,Event)
------------------------

    Event = open  -- the panel has just been activated.
          = close -- the panel window is about to be closed.


dispatch_panel_event(Panel,Event(Ev..),Class(name(Name),Etc..))   % panel works
---------------------------------------------------------------

This predicate generates the alternative standard forms of panel_event.  It should
be used in preference to calling panel_event directly.


panel_view(Panel,Item_access..)     % panel view
-------------------------------

This predicate is used to read or write the properties (including name and place)
associated with any item in the panel.  A number of read/write operations can be 
specified (panel_view is variadic) and each will be attempted. Failure of any 
individual operation does not impact any other operation and panel_view always 
succeeds. An item's item class determines how the Value is interpreted. With the
exception of replace ('<=') and delete, common variables unified with one operation 
can be used in subsequent operations, permitting, for example, the contents of one 
field to be written to another with a single panel_view call, as in

            panel_view(example,field(fred):Contents,field(sam):=Contents)

With this in mind:

            panel_view(Panel,Item_access..)

Item_access can be any number of terms of the following forms:

    Class(Name) : Value     unify Value with a component of Items current value.
                            A component can be a property, a list of properties,
                            or a form defined by the class, e.g., if Class=field,
                            a variable Value will be unified with a symbol which
                            is the field's contents, as in

                                    field(fred):Text
                
                            Note the semantics of this operation is defined by:
                              
                              panel_item_read(Item,Value)
                
                            which unifies Value as appropriate for this Item.

    Name : Value            shorthand form of that above. e.g.: fred:Text

    Class(name(Name),place(Place..),Ps..) : Value

                            longhand form of the above, e.g.:
 
                                    field(name(fred),place(P..),Ps..)
                                Note that any unbound variables in the property list
                                are bound and can be used in subsequent operations.


    Class(Name) := Value    assign a new value to the panel Item. As for ':', Value
                                can be a property, a property list, or a class
                                defined form, e.g.,

                                field(fred):='1234'
                          
                            Note this calls:

                                panel_item_write(Item,Value,NewItem,Graf)

                            which is responsible for any Graf structure that
                            will cause the display to be updated appropriately.
                            dograf(Panel,Graf) is the ONLY side effect in addition
                            to the object assignment. Shorthand and longhand forms
                            of the item are allowed as described above.



Less common Item_access forms include:   

    Class(Name) <= NewItem  replace Item with NewItem. Erase and the old item,
                            draw the new one, and invalidate any exposed area.
                            Note that no property binding occurs for the replacement
                            operation due to an implementation decision to conserve
                            stack space.

    [Items..]<=[NewItems..] deletes Items and inserts NewItems
                            
    [] : Items  -- Complete list of items in the panel.
  
    [] <= Item (or [Items..]) -- to REPLACE panel item contents.

    delete(Class(Name)) -- remove an item from the panel contents

    insert(Class(Name,Place,Props..))  -- add a new item into the panel contents

    Item                  Unify with Item in Panels content list, this can also be used as 
                          a generator, e.g.,
                          
                       panel_view(panel,button(name(Name),_..))
                            
                          will generate on backtracking, the names of all the buttons in 
                          'panel', and

                       foreach(panel_view(panel,button(Etc..),
                                                button(Etc..):=style(rectangle)) do [])

                          changes all buttons in 'panel' to a rectangle style.
            
                          This form of panel_view will fail if Item cannot be unified with
                          with an item in the designated panel.
    
   **** N.B. panel_view will also fail if Panel is not open. **** 


panel_id(Panel,Template,Window)   % panel sys
-------------------------------

Panel identifiers have two forms:

    Template        % Template is a symbol identifying the panel_definition to be used
    Template:ID     % Template as above, ID is application supplied term used to
                    %   distinguish instances of the same definition.

    'panel_id', given a valid 'Panel' name, 'Template' and 'Window' are unified with the 
name of the panel_definition and the corresponding window name respectively.


panel_open(Panel)
panel_open(Panel,Init..)
panel_open(Panel,pos(X,Y))
panel_open(Panel,pos(X,Y),Init..)   % panel sys
---------------------------------

This call activates an existing panel, or open a new panel with an existing 
definition, or to create a panel with the given name by referring to panel_definition
clauses.  Panel can be either a template name (symbol) or an instance (Template:Id).
(in the latter case, the panel_defintion for Template is used to create the panel.)

If pos(X,Y) is the second argument, the stored panel position is ignored, and the panel
is opened centred at the provided X,Y coordinates.  Init.. is an optional sequence of 
panel_view operations which may be used to initialize the panel.

Open.. in the Panels menu lists panels with definitions found loaded (and shows the 
context they are found in. Double clicking does a panel_open.
 
No context load or unload is ever done -- applications must do this explicitly.


panel_create(Panel)
panel_create(Panel,pos(X,Y))
panel_create(Panel,Window,Content)  % panel sys
----------------------------------

panel_create creates a panel, but does not open it.  The first form creates a panel from
a loaded panel_definition.  The second, does the same except the position can be overridden 
(created panel is centred at the provided X,Y coordinates). The third form creates a panel
given Window (a list of the form [Pos,Size,options(Options..)]) and Content (a list of 
items). This allows Panels to be created dynamically, i.e., no panel_definition clause 
is required.


panel_save(Panel)   % panel sys
-----------------

Saves the current definition of the panel in a file. If the panel has just been
created, the user is prompted for the file name; otherwise it is saved in the
file from which it was was loaded. Fails if the user cancel's from a dialog.


panel_close(Panel)  % panel sys
------------------

Closes the window with a save dialog (see above) if the panel definition has been 
changed. Fails if the user 'cancel's from any dialog.

panel_reopen(Panel) % panel sys
-------------------

Closes and reopens an existing panel.  Used to change window attributes.


panel_rename(Panel, NewPanel) % panel sys
-----------------------------

Rename an existing panel.


ispanel(Panel)  % panel sys
--------------

Acts as a tester or generator for open panels.


panel_attribute(Panel, Attr_access) % panel sys
-----------------------------------

General access to panel attributes.


panel_menu(Panel,List,Choice) 
panel_menu(Panel,List,Item,Choice) 
panel_menu(Panel,List,Item,X,Y,Choice)   % panel sys
---------------------------------------- 

panel_menu/3 displays a pop-up menu in the panel at the location of the last mouse down, 
fails if no menu item is chosen, else it unifies Choice with the menu entry chosen.
panel_menu/4 specifies the item (either list index, or list element) on the menu to be
positioned at the last mouse down. panel_menu/6 specifies the item and co-ordinates to
position the menu.



Creating New Classes
--------------------

The visual and behavioural characteristics of a class are defined by a set of class
methods, and a set of default event handlers.  The class methods provide ways of creating
reading, writing, etc. items independant of their context, i.e., which panel they're in.
The panels system provides a set of default methods which may be sufficient in many cases.
The class methods are:

panel_item_class(class_name).
-----------------------------

To cause class_name to appear in the panel editors 'NewÉ' pop-up menu; no default provided.


panel_item_new(Class,Name,X,Y,Item)
-------------------------------------------
    
To create a new item.
    Class = new item class name,
    Name  = item instance name (any Prolog term) 
    X,Y   = top left corner of new Item
    Item  = your new item.
The default displays an error dialog indicating the method is undefined.
    

panel_item_graf(Item,Graf)
-------------------------- 
   
    Graf is a structure that can be used in dograf to draw Item
    Note: this is now the only action taken on the display screen, so
    this item class method is responsible for erasing an area to draw in, 
    setting the penmode, fillmode, and so on.  The default method draws a black
    rectangle in the 'place' and outputs a message to the console (if present).


panel_item_grow(Item,H,V)
-------------------------

    H or V = 0 is no growth, 
    or provides lower limit(s) for horizontal (H) and vertical (V) size.
    The default is H,V = 0,0 (no re-size possible) 
  

panel_item_hit(Item,X,Y)
-------------------------

    Succeeds if a mousedown at window coordinates X,Y 'hits' the object; the default
succeeds if X,Y is in the 'place' rectangle. 
  

panel_item_read(Item,Value)
---------------------------

    Unifies Value with a property or class value of Item, w.g., the class value of a 
    button is its state.  The default supports all property access; the class 
    implementation need only provide support for class value, e.g., if Value is a variable
    (or not unifiable with a property or property list), it may be unified with the class
    value using a class specific method.


panel_item_write(Item1,Value,Item2,Graf)
----------------------------------------
    
    Write Value to Item1 producing Item2 and resultant Graf update.  Vaule may be a whole
    new object, a single property, or a class value.  This method is used to implement
    Item1:=Value in panel_view.  A default is provided for writing properties or whole
    objects, but may result in unnecessary redrawing of the object, e.g., redrawing
    field objects when the field is locked or unlocked.  Therefore the field class provides
    a method which results in no graphic update when writing to the lock property.  In
    addition, the class must support writing the class value form.  The default supports
    the following semntics:
        1. If Value is a variable, the operation is a noop, i.e., Item1=Item2, Graf=_
        2. If Value is a property, or property list, the appropriate properties are
           replaced and the object is redrawn as defined by panel_item_graf.
        3. If Value is a complete object of the same class, the old property list is
           repalced by the new property list, subject to mimimum size restrictions
           defined by panel_item_grow, and the object is redrawn as defined by 
           panel_item_graf.
        4. Otherwise, the operation is a noop (see 1.)



Provided Classes:
-----------------

In addition to the form of objects in each class, the read (panel_view ':' operator) and 
write (panel_view ':=' operator) behaviour, and default operational behaviour are described.


Button Class
    
    The 'button' class subsumes several earlier classes like text, icon, check_box, 
hotspot, and popup, as well as button. The form of a button object is:

        button(name(Name),      % a symbol identifying the button in a panel
               place(Place..),  % a list of 4 integers defining a rectangle
               style(Style),    % one of standard, designate, transparent, rectangle,
                                %   shadow, 'radio button', 'check box', motif,
                                %   'motif radio button', 'motif check box'  
               label(Label),    % a symbol, may be used to distinguish radio buttons
               state(State),    % 'on','off', 'nil' (used to disable hilighting),
                                %   or 'disable' (no hilighting, grayed appearance) 
               font(F,S,St..),  % font name, size and style specification
               icon(Id),        % icon Id, 0 indicates none
               menu(Ms..)       % menu associated with a button (not implemented)
              )                 % end of value specification

    The 'Style','State', and 'menu(Menu..)' terms affect the operational behaviour of the
button.  Other terms in the value only affect the appearance and can be altered using
the button editor (see below).  (Of course, the programmer can use panel_view to alter
any parts of the object definition.)  (Due to the way in which disabled buttons are
rendered, disabled, transparent buttons on patterned backgraounds, or pictures, do not
work well.  However, no attempt is made to prohibit this combination.) 

The button class value is its state (one of 'on', 'off', 'nil' or 'disable'), i.e, the state 
of buttons can be read and written using a simple form of panel_view, as in

            panel_view(panel,button(fred):State)
            panel_view(panel,button(fred):=disable)  

    Default behaviour for non-check boxes and non-radio buttons:
        On select, if the state is 'off' and the menu is empty, set the new state to 'on'
            and hilite the button (different styles hilite differently). If the menu
            is non-empty,  set the new state to 'on' (hiliting the button), and drop the
            associated menu below the button. If a menu selction is made, issue:
          panel_event(Panel,menu(Selection),button(Name,Place,Value))
            Then, set the button state to 'off' and un-hilite the button. If the state
            is 'nil' or 'disable' when the button is selected, no state changes and no 
            hiliting is done.  Non-empty menus remain active if the state is 'nil'.
        On unselect, if the state is 'on', set the new state to 'off' and unhilite the 
            button. (The default panels system behaviour will also issue a click event
            if the select and subsequent unselect occur while the mouse is pointing at 
            the button, or no menu selection is made.) 
        On a <return> or <enter> key, the first button in the panel with the style 
            'designate' will be issued a click event.
        On any other key, the first button whose first key of its label matches the 
            keystroke will be issued a click. (Note that associated menus have no effect
            when this happens.) See 'Example 4' for an effective use of this behaviour.
    
    Default behaviour for check boxes:
        On select, if the state is 'off', set the new state to 'on' and hilite the button
            (different styles hilite differently). If the state is 'on', set the new state
            to 'off' and unhilite the button. Issue (button value has new state):
          panel_event(Panel,update(Old_state),button(Name,Etc..))
        On unselect, do nothing.

    Default behaviour for radio buttons:
        On select, set the state to 'on' and hilite the button (different styles hilite 
            differently). If there is another radio button with the same name in the same 
            panel in the 'on' state, turn it off. Issue (button value has new state):
          panel_event(Panel,update(Old_label),button(Name,Etc..))
            where Old_label is the label on the button that was turned 'off'.
        On unselect, do nothing.


Field Class
    
    Fields are containers for user editable text.  While they are similar to earlier field
objects, they have been extended in several ways.  First, they are multiline and fully
support cut/copy/paste; in essence they are a mini text window with no scroll bars.  The
font style and size can be specified by the developer. Finally, they have an optional
menu associated with them which may be used to select values for the field.  (This 
combination of fields and popup menus is very common in existing panels' applications.) 
The form of a field object is:


        field(name(Name),       % a term identifying the button in a panel
              place(Place..),   % a list of 4 integers defining a rectangle
              pre(Pre_Sel),     % symbol prior to selection in field
              selection(Sel),   % symbol representing selection in field
              post(Post_Sel),   % symbol after selection in field
              top(Top),         % top line visible in field (integer) 
              font(F,S,St..),   % font name, size and style specification
              lock(OnOff),      % flag indicating whether the field is editable
              lines(OnOff),     % flag indicating whether lines are to be visible
              style(Style),     % one of transparent, opaque, rectangle, shadow, motif
              menu(Sel..),      % menu associated with a field
              exitset(exitchs..)% set of edit exit chars, default is <tab>,<enter>
              )                 % end of value specification
    
    The 'lock(Lock)' and 'menu(Menu..)' terms affect the operational behaviour of the
button.  Other terms in the value only affect the appearance and can be altered using
the field editor (see below).

The field class value is the symbol formed by concatenating the 'pre', 'selection', and
'post' property values.  On writing a symbol to a field, the 'pre' and 'post' properties
are set to '', and the 'selection' is set to the symbol.


    Default behaviour:
        On select, if the menu is non-empty, the menu is popped up with the current 
        contents positioned in the top left corner of the field.  If the contents do not 
        match a menu item, the top menu element is positioned in the top left corner.  If
        a selection is made, the slection replaces the current contents of the field and 
        the following panel event is issued:
            panel_event(Panel,update(pre(Prev),selection(Sel),post(Post),top(Top)),
                              field(Name,Etc..))
        If no selection is made the select is ignored, possibly to become the front end of a 
        'click' event.

        On click, the user is placed in field edit mode. The cursor/selection is defined
        by the current contents of the field. Edit mode is normally terminated by mouse
        events outside the field, by keystrokes corresponding to characters in the exitset,
        or by command keys. Note that the field background lines will disappear during 
        editing; this is a current implementation restriction.  Cut, copy, paste, and 
        select all command keys, and their menu equivalents, have the expected semantics 
        during field editing, and can be used to transfer contents between fields. On 
        termination, an update panel_event is issued, as described above.

        If the field is locked, the field cannot be edited.


List Class

    Lists are scrollable lists of text lines from which single, or multiple selections can
be made.  Single selections can also be dragged to another position in the visible portion 
of the list.  By default, the terms representing the individual lines of the list are 
written to a  symbol, truncated as necessary, and then displayed as text.  A hook has been 
provided to allow alternative graphing of the terms, provided they fit in the same area as 
the default text.  Lists are often used with fields for adding, deleting, or changing items
in the list (See some of the class editors for examples).  The form of a list object is:

        list(name(Name),        % a symbol identifying the button in a panel
             place(Place..),    % a list of 4 integers defining a rectangle
             contents(L..),     % contents (terms) of the list
             selection(I,Sel),  % current selection: index (integer) and selection (term)
                                %   or lists of indices and selected terms 
             top(T),            % index into list of top displayed term 
             style(Style),      % one of rectangle, shadow, or motif
             font(F,S,St..)     % font name, size and style specification
            )                   % end of value specification

There is no class value for a list.

    Default behaviour:
        On select, the following augmented select panel event is issued:
        panel_event(Panel,select(X,Y,Index),list(Name,Etc..))
      where 'Index' specifies which item in the list is at coordinates X,Y.
        On select/3 event, the text line at the mouse co-ordinates is hilited, and the 
      previous selection, if any, is unselected. The following panel_event is issued:
        panel_event(Panel,update(Old_selection),list(Name,Etc..))
      where the new selection can be obtained from item properties. Multiple selections
      can be made using the shift key when selecting.  This adds the item to the selection,
      if it wasn't previusly selected, or deletes it from the selection, if it wasn't.
      If the selection is dragged to a new position, the following panel_event is issued:
        panel_event(Panel,update(contents(OldContents..),selection(OldIndex,OldSelection)),
                    list(Name,Etc..))


    As noted above, it is sometimes desirable to have the application draw the 'lines' in
the list.  For this purpose the following hook has been provided for list objects:

        panel_list_line_graf([Index,        % index specifying list line to draw
                              Select,       % index specifying current selection
                              List],        % list
                             [Xl,Yt,Xr,Yb], % rectangle covering visible part of line
                             font(F,        % font id
                                  S,        % font size
                                  [St..],   % font style(s)
                                  Ascent,   % size characteristics..
                                  Descent,
                                  Leading),
                              Window,       % a window to be used in text sizing
                              Graf)         % resultant graf structure   

 

Editing Panels
--------------

    Each class should support an edit dialog/panel which is invoked by double clicking on
a selected object of that class. When this occurs the follwing panel_event is generated:

    panel_event(Panel,edit(X,Y),Class(Name,Etc..))

The class implementation then responds to this event by invoking the appropriate edit
dialog.  (See the file 'Editing' for more information on the class editors).

    In addition to the object editors, selected objects can be cut/copy/pasted and deleted
using standard Mac editing techniques.  However, be forewarned that copied objects are
exact copies, any name duplication or other conflicts must be resolved by the developer.


Motif Style 
-----------

    Motif panels, buttons, fields, lists, radio buttons, and check boxes are now fully
supported inside panels.  However, the graphics has changed to permit various fonts and
styles to be clearly displayed.  Half-tone shading has been replaced by colour/gray scales, 
which means they can't be used on monchrome Mac's (e.g., Mac Plus, SE, SE/30).  The default
colour is defined by the fact 'motif_colour(yellow).'; to change the colour overload this
clause with your own definition.  The background colour is set separately using the panel
editor.


Miscellaneous:
--------------

    panel_directory(Folder)         % panel uif
    -----------------------

    Unifies Folder with the directory name from which Panels was loaded; this is
    provided mainly so online help can find auxiliary files.


    panelfont(Font,Size)            % panel works
    --------------------

    Unifies Font and Size with the default panel font; all text associated with
    pre-defined item classes default to this font. Of course, user supplied items
    can use whatever font they wish.


    panel_text_size(Text,Length,Height)
    panel_text_size(Text,Length,Height,Descent)
    panel_text_size(Text,font(Font,Size,St..),Length,Height,Descent)   % panel works
    --------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Calculates the length, height and optionally descent (in pixels) of Text displayed 
    in default, or specified font.


    panel_expand_rect(Rect1,Dx,Dy,Rect2)       % panel works
    -------------------------

    Rect1 and Rect2 are definitions of rectangles, i.e., of the form [X1,Y1,X2,Y2].
    Rect2 is Rect1 expanded in the x and y directions by Dx and Dy respectively.


    panel_target_item(Itemlist,X,Y,Item)       % panel works
    panel_target_item(Panel,X,Y,Item)
    -------------------------

    Item is a member of Itemlist, or defined in Panel, whose boundaries contain the 
	point X,Y. If no items meet this requirement, Item is bound to the void item 
	(see below).


    voiditem(void(name(void),place(0,0,0,0)))  % panel works
    -----------------------------------------

    Defines the void item (the target of a mouse down inside the panel window, but not
    'hitting' an item in the panel.


    panels_version(Version)         % panels
    -----------------------

    Unifies Version with current version of Panels; this will correspond with the
    context name for Panels when it's loaded as delivered.
